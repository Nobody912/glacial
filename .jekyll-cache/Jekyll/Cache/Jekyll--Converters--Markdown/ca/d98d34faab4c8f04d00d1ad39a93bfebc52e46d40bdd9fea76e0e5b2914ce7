I"‚<h1 id="about-me">ABOUT ME</h1>

<p>My name is Erik Ji. I am a computer engineering major at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
<br />
<br />
I attended Lynbrook High School in San Jose, CA and graduated in 2020. During my time in high school, I developed interests in many areas, both software and hardware.
<br />
<br />
I built my PC and learned about hardware interfacing, electronics maintenance, and higher-level operating system function. As a result of building a system, I have developed a taste for PC gaming.
<br />
<br />
Programming has became one of primary pastimes, mainly based in cryptography and encryption. It is something I wish to pursue in the future.
<br />
<br />
As a young child, I was fascinated by electronics. During my high school years, with an understanding of work safety, increased tooling skills, and finanical resources, I was able to experiment with DIY electronics and study basic electronics design. Iâ€™ve completed projects from as simple as an SBC-controlled LED to interfacing Soviet ICs and cold-cathode indicator tubes with modern hardware.
<br />
<br />
Recently, I have taken great interest in mechanical keyboards: the clickity-clackity predecessors to the typical modern membrane keyboard. While my understanding behind the hardware and software that power modern mechanical keyboards, I like them. A lot. I have yet to find my endgame build.</p>
